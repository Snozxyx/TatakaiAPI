Alongside the appearance of the gates, various humans were transformed into hunters and bestowed superhuman abilities. Responsible for entering the gates and clearing the dungeons within, many hunters chose to form guilds to secure their livelihoods.\n\nSung Jin-Woo is an E-rank hunter dubbed as the weakest hunter of all mankind. While exploring a supposedly safe dungeon, he and his party encounter an unusual tunnel leading to a deeper area. Enticed by the prospect of treasure, the group presses forward, only to be confronted with horrors beyond their imagination. Miraculously, Jin-Woo survives the incident and soon finds that he now has access to an interface visible only to him. This mysterious system promises him the power he has long dreamed of—but everything comes at a price.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Ore dake Level Up na Ken was released on Blu-ray & DVD in four volumes from March 27, 2024, to June 26, 2024.","season":"winter","year":2024,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"00:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 00:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"},{"mal_id":1468,"type":"anime","name":"Crunchyroll","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1468/Crunchyroll"},{"mal_id":2837,"type":"anime","name":"Netmarble","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2837/Netmarble"},{"mal_id":2839,"type":"anime","name":"Kakao piccoma","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2839/Kakao_piccoma"},{"mal_id":2872,"type":"anime","name":"D&C Media","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2872/D_C_Media"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":56,"type":"anime","name":"A-1 Pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/56/A-1_Pictures"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"Adult Cast","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"},{"mal_id":82,"type":"anime","name":"Urban Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/82/Urban_Fantasy"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":52701,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/52701/Dungeon_Meshi","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1711/142478.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1711/142478t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1711/142478l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1711/142478.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1711/142478t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1711/142478l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MUJFsL_rE6E?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Dungeon Meshi"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Dungeon Food"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Dungeon Dining"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ダンジョン飯"},{"type":"English","title":"Delicious in Dungeon"}],"title":"Dungeon Meshi","title_english":"Delicious in Dungeon","title_japanese":"ダンジョン飯","title_synonyms":["Dungeon Food","Dungeon Dining"],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":24,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2024-01-04T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2024-06-13T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":4,"month":1,"year":2024},"to":{"day":13,"month":6,"year":2024}},"string":"Jan 4, 2024 to Jun 13, 2024"},"duration":"25 min per ep","rating":"R - 17+ (violence & profanity)","score":8.59,"scored_by":283153,"rank":113,"popularity":442,"members":553410,"favorites":11793,"synopsis":"Adventuring knight Laios Touden leads a small party through a seemingly endless dungeon, a subterranean maze full of dangerous monsters and precarious traps. Through the use of advanced magic, an explorer can sometimes be resurrected, allowing them to learn from past mistakes and give traversing the dungeon another go. However, when a powerful dragon eats Falin, Laios' spellcasting sister, she sends her brother and his companions back to the beginning to save them from permanent ends.\n\nThough strapped for cash and equipment, Laios resolves to fight his way through the dungeon and rescue Falin before she can be digested by the dragon. Despite some of Laios' allies abandoning him, two remain by his side: elven mage Marcille Donato and halfling locksmith Chilchuck Tims. Due to their lack of funds, the party faces the daunting prospect of starving before being able to complete their quest. However, they find salvation in Senshi, a dwarven warrior with a penchant for cooking and safely eating defeated monsters.\n\nWith Senshi's culinary expertise, Laios and his companions struggle through the dungeon while learning about gourmet dining—and each other—along the way.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Dungeon Meshi was released on Blu-ray and DVD in four volumes from April 24, 2024, to July 24, 2024.","season":"winter","year":2024,"broadcast":{"day":"Thursdays","time":"22:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Thursdays at 22:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":539,"type":"anime","name":"Ultra Super Pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/539/Ultra_Super_Pictures"},{"mal_id":1261,"type":"anime","name":"Good Smile Company","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1261/Good_Smile_Company"},{"mal_id":1617,"type":"anime","name":"Tencent Japan","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1617/Tencent_Japan"},{"mal_id":1696,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":803,"type":"anime","name":"Trigger","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/803/Trigger"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":47,"type":"anime","name":"Gourmet","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/47/Gourmet"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]},{"mal_id":51180,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/51180/Youkoso_Jitsuryoku_Shijou_Shugi_no_Kyoushitsu_e_3rd_Season","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1332/139318.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1332/139318t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1332/139318l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1332/139318.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1332/139318t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1332/139318l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0yOULRwyp2o?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Youkoso Jitsuryoku Shijou Shugi no Kyoushitsu e 3rd Season"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Welcome to the Classroom of the Elite"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"You-jitsu 3rd Season"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"You-zitsu 3rd Season"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"ようこそ実力至上主義の教室へ 3rd Season"},{"type":"English","title":"Classroom of the Elite III"}],"title":"Youkoso Jitsuryoku Shijou Shugi no Kyoushitsu e 3rd Season","title_english":"Classroom of the Elite III","title_japanese":"ようこそ実力至上主義の教室へ 3rd Season","title_synonyms":["Welcome to the Classroom of the Elite","You-jitsu 3rd Season","You-zitsu 3rd Season"],"type":"TV","source":"Light novel","episodes":13,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2024-01-03T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2024-03-27T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":3,"month":1,"year":2024},"to":{"day":27,"month":3,"year":2024}},"string":"Jan 3, 2024 to Mar 27, 2024"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 -
