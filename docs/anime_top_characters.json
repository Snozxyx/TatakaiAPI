(Sagittarius)\nBlood Type: A\nNationality: Britannia\nHeight: 178 cm (5'10\")\nOccupation: Student, Terrorist, Knightmare Pilot, Politician, Emperor, Prince\nAllegiance: Order of the Black Knights\nPosition: Leader of the Black Knights\nKnightmare: Sutherland, Burai, Gawain, Shinkirou\n\nLelouch is the main protagonist of the anime/manga series Code Geass. He is the Eleventh Prince of the Holy Britannian Empire and the son of the 98th Emperor of Britannia, Charles zi Britannia.\n\nLelouch is a very clever individual who is also calm, sophisticated, and arrogant due to his aristocratic upbringing. While at school, Lelouch conducts himself as a friendly, likable, and often an easygoing student. However, this is a mask to hide his true nature. While as Zero, his true nature is expressed. His charisma and beliefs in justice gain him the trust and respect of many soldiers and leaders.\n\nHe is known for having a very stoic personality. He never cared about schoolwork, seeing the entire thing as trivial, even though his high intelligence would make it easy for him. He enjoys seeking out challenges, often playing chess against the nobility. In general, Lelouch takes most day-to-day affairs with open disinterest, often not even noticing the affection of others, especially Shirley, his classmate. He has a strong dislike for nobles, viewing them as tepid and \"overprivileged parasites.\"\n\nMany characters have noted that Lelouch is entirely selfish, as his desire to remake the world into what he wants it to become from his desire to avenge his mother's apparent death and Nunnally's sake. However, in time, he realizes that this goal is not just for them but also the entire world.\n\nDespite his cold, calculating demeanor and ruthlessness in battle, he can be a rather compassionate person to his friends and loved ones. To Nunnally, he is a loving older brother, and to Suzaku, a loyal friend, although the two are enemies. Lelouch, at first glance, seems to have relatively little concern for the well-being of his subordinates, but in reality, he does care about them, seeing them as valuable allies.\n\n\nBackground (as Lelouch):\n\nBackground (as Zero):\n\nFirst Season:\n\nSecond Season:\n\n\nGeass:\nLelouch's Geass, bestowed upon him by C.C., gives him \"The Power of Absolute Obedience,\" allowing him to plant commands within a person's mind upon eye contact in a manner comparable to hypnosis. Activation of his Geass is visually represented by the manifestation of a Geass Sigil in his left eye. Commands dictated are written into the minds of the designated targets, the Sigil projecting him from his eye to theirs.\n\n\nOf all the Geass abilities in the series, Lelouch's has been explored the most and also seems to have the most restrictions, and side effects of any Geass introduced:(Source: Code Geass Wiki, Villains Wiki, Heroes Wiki, Anime and Manga Universe Wiki)"},{"mal_id":40,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/character/40/Luffy_Monkey_D","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/9/310307.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/9/310307.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/9/310307t.webp"}},"name":"Luffy Monkey D.","name_kanji":"モンキー・D・ルフィ","nicknames":["Mugiwara","Straw Hat"],"favorites":147097,"about":"Age: 17; 19\nBirthdate: May 5, Taurus\nHeight: 172 cm\nBlood type: F\nAffiliation: Straw Hat Pirates\nPosition: Captain\nDevil fruit: Gomu Gomu no Mi (Gum Gum Fruit), \nType: Paramecia, \nBounty: \nLuffy is the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates and is best friends with all of them and values them over all else. At first glance, Luffy does not appear to be very intelligent, often seeing things in a childish manner and can easily be amazed by the simplest things. However, because he views the world in a straightforward and simple manner, he is occasionally the only person who can see past the events and see what should be done.\n\nLuffy seems to have an unstoppable appetite, a characteristic that is common to the Japanese archetype of the (at times simple-minded) young male hero/adventurer with a heart of gold; perhaps the hunger more so in Luffy's case due to having an elastic stomach. Luffy is also another one of the several characters given the middle initial \"D.\"\n\nAlthough Luffy is fairly lightheaded and a funny character, he has an unstoppable sense of determination, optimism, and commitment and will do anything to stand up for his friends and comrades. Along with that, he has great courage to back it up as well as unbelievable strength. Ever since consuming the devil fruit he was shown to be not worried about his inability to swim, much like his brother. Much of these traits are common among D's. His only display of true fear is towards his grandfather, to the point that he is intimidated at the mere mention of him.\n\nLuffy never kills any of his enemies, no matter how cold-hearted they are; instead, he frequently sends the villain flying, knocking them out or beating them to a point that they are almost near death, which results in some of the villains searching for revenge, such as Buggy the Clown and Alvida. Oda explains that it's not a question of morality so much as a matter of punishing the villains for their crimes - he feels that killing the villains lets them off too lightly, whereas he considers letting them live to see their dreams be ruined a far more fitting punishment.\n\nLuffy's dream is to find the One Piece and become Pirate King. He knows that to achieve his goal, he will have to defeat many strong opponents, including the World Government and his childhood hero Shanks."},{"mal_id":45627,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/character/45627/Levi","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/2/241413.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/2/241413.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/characters/2/241413t.webp"}},"name":"Levi","name_kanji":"リヴァイ","nicknames":[],"favorites":145194,"about":"Birthday: December 25\nHeight: 160 cm (5'3\")\nWeight: 65 kg (143 lbs)\nAffiliations: Scouting Legion, Special Operations Squad\n\nLevi is known as humanity's most powerful soldier.
